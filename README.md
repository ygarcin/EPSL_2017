## Contents
    Matlab codes for evaluating how erosion rates derived from 10Be surface concentrations change as a function of imposed changes in erosion rates to better understand how 10Be data relate to a real erosion-rate history.
    Scripts for generating Figure 7 and EA-1 on the paper "Short-lived increase in erosion during the African Humid Period: evidence from the northern Kenya Rift".
    First run Build_Ensemble.m to generate Table_response.res containing the 10Be-modeled erosion rates as response of imposed erosion rates. Then run Script_Figure7.m and Script_Electronic_Annex_EA1.m to plot Figures 7 and EA-1.
